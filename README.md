# Funi 

# Project Summary
It was the idea of a discount coupon platform for students that we planned to develop together with a team at Funi SabancÄ± University. Thanks to this application, students at major universities would be able to benefit from a certain number of discount coupons and various campaigns after they verified that they were students at those universities and registered in the system. An application would appear that made purchasing extremely easy.
